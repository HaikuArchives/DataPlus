Multiple_Regression Notes

* A file reference is sent instead of the data. If the DP data is in the form of a multiple set, it is combined into a file (how). [or should only the first set be analyzed?] This gets back to the basic question as to how we combine sets..

-- MR cannot be invoked unless only one group, or if combined..

* If the X,Y,Z fields are checked, a MR using the residuals of thehose fields are sequentially run, otherwise a matrix of all fields is run.
